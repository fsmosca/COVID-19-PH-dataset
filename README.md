#### 3. "address reference.csv"
Folder: `doc\Others`  
This file contains basic geographic info of people with confirmed cases. Together with "DOH Data Drop Case Information.csv" this file can be used to plot location on the map of confirmed cases for up to city and municipality level. I will try to update this daily when there is new confirmed cases reports from DOH.
